About The App:
This app presents the user with a list of popular movies available coming out the world over. This is especially useful in situations where one is planning a movie night out or a get together.
The movie collection of the app gets updated in real-time and the user has the option of applying multiple different filters for getting the movie list that best suits their needs. For instance, if a user is interested in the al-time popular movies, they can apply the necessary filter and get the relevant movie list.

On the technical front, the app makes use of the PICASSO Image Library, content providers, recycler views, activity lifecycles, app compat and custom array adapters, among other things. The app also has the ability to handle network unavailability events. It can also adapt to different screen orientations to provide for a comfortable user experience.
